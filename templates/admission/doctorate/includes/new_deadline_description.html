      No later than 24 months after the CDD grants PhD admission, the candidate must take a confirmation exam.

      If the circumstances justify it, the deadline may be extended by the support
      committee, with the agreement of the DDC on the proposed deadline. This deadline may also be shortened due to
      constraints imposed by the funder, e.g. in the context of the renewal of the mandate or the doctoral scholarship
      (e.g. the renewal of the mandate of the F.R.S.-FNRS candidates).

      The aim of the confirmation exam is to establish, on the basis of the state of progress of the research work,
      that it is likely to lead to the submission of a PhD thesis (Art. 2.3.1. of the PhD Regulations).
