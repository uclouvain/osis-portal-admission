      Within a maximum period of 24 months from the date of admission to the doctorate by the DDC, the candidate shall
      present a confirmation paper.

      If the circumstances justify it, the deadline may be extended by the support
      committee, with the agreement of the DDC on the proposed deadline. This deadline may also be shortened due to
      constraints imposed by the funder, e.g. in the context of the renewal of the mandate or the doctoral scholarship
      (e.g. the renewal of the mandate of the F.R.S.-FNRS candidates).

      The purpose of the confirmation test is to establish, on the basis of the state of progress of the research work,
      that it can lead to the production of a doctoral thesis (art. 2.3.1. of the doctoral regulations).
